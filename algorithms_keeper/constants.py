# Multiple Pull Request Detected

@{user_login}, we are extremely excited that you want to submit multiple algorithms \

pull requests at a time to maintain the quality of the code.

This pull request is being closed as the user already has an open pull request. \
Please focus on your previous pull request before opening another one. Thank you for \

If you're facing any problem on how to mark a checkbox, please read the following \
instructions:
- Read a point one at a time and think if it is relevant to the pull request or not.
- If it is, then mark it by putting a `x` between the square bracket like so: `[x]`

***NOTE: Only `[x]` is supported so if you have put any other letter or symbol \
between the brackets, that will be marked as invalid. If that is the case then please \
open a new pull request with the appropriate changes.***

# Pull Request Report

@{user_login} Hello! I'm a bot made to check all the pull request Python files. \
First of all, I want to say thank you for your time and interest in this project and \
for opening a pull request. There seems to be missing requirements in some of the \
Python files submitted in this pull request. Please read through the report and make \
the necessary changes. You can take a look at the relevant links provided after the \
report.

<details><summary><b>What are node paths? ðŸ”½</b></summary>

> The report contains headings and a checklist where the items are paths to the \
class/function/parameter where the requirement is missing. Node paths are double \
colon `::` separated names and can be in any of the following format:
> - Class path: `[file_name]::[class_name]`
> - Function path: `[file_name]::[function_name]`
> - Function parameter path: `[file_name]::[function_name]::[parameter_name]`
> - Method path: `[file_name]::[class_name]::[function_name]`
> - Method parameter path: \
`[file_name]::[class_name]::[function_name]::[parameter_name]`
