Only the constants which are accessed throughout the module are defined here.
Constants related to a specific event are defined in their own module. So a
constant related to pull request will be defined in the `pull_requests` module.

@{user_login}, we are extremely excited that you want to submit multiple algorithms \

pull requests at a time to maintain the quality of the code.

This pull request is being closed as the user already has an open pull request. \
Please focus on your previous pull request before opening another one. Thank you for \

If you're facing any problem on how to mark a checkbox, please read the following \
instructions:
- Read a point one at a time and think if it is relevant to the pull request or not.
- If it is, then mark it by putting a `x` between the square bracket like so: `[x]`

***NOTE: Only `[x]` is supported so if you have put any other letter or symbol \
between the brackets, that will be marked as invalid. If that is the case then please \
open a new pull request with the appropriate changes.***

- `@algorithms-keeper review` to trigger the checks for only added pull request files
- `@algorithms-keeper review-all` to trigger the checks for all the pull request \
